printf uses line buffering here

In Program 1, output is delayed until newline character is met in the buffer.
Hence, after fork(), it is delayed both for parent and child process. Then, newline character is printf-ed, which causes printing the buffer with string "Hello" in both processes.

In Program 2, "Hello" is printed immediately due to newline character in the string. Thus, after fork(), only newline character is printf-ed in both processes.
